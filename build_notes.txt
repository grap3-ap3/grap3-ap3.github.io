The hope here is to save from having to re-re-relearn pelican. 

When you cd into E:\Dropbox\phillipGrimes\pelican\grap3-ap3.github.io, this is the master branch. 

Need to checkout the content branch to modify the site. 

Once in content branch, make changes in E:\Dropbox\phillipGrimes\pelican\grap3-ap3.github.io\content

When you're happy with changes: 
	* pelican content -o output -s publishconf.py
		This makes the site and pushes data to E:\Dropbox\phillipGrimes\pelican\grap3-ap3.github.io\output
		
	Then push to the content repo:
	
	* git add .
	* git commit -m "What did you change?"
	* git push origin content
	
The last step is awkward, but it works. 
	* copy E:\Dropbox\phillipGrimes\pelican\grap3-ap3.github.io\output
		paste to E:\Dropbox\phillipGrimes\pelican
	* Change into master branch 
	* git pull to ensure you have all the proper data
	* delete all files EXCEPT "CNAME" and the .git directory
	* copy all content from E:\Dropbox\phillipGrimes\pelican\output to E:\Dropbox\phillipGrimes\pelican\grap3-ap3.github.io\
	* delete E:\Dropbox\phillipGrimes\pelican\output
	
	then: 
	
	* git add .
	* git commit -m "what are you pushing to master?"
	* git push origin master
